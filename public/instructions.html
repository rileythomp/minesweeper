        <h1>Minesweeper</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Your goal is to clear all of the safe reveal every square without clicking on a mine.</li>
            <li>When you click on a square, it will reveal the number of mines surrounding it.</li>
            <li>If there are no mines surroudning that square, it will reveal all the squares around it recursively.</li>
            <li>Using the number of mines surrounding a cell, you can deduce which cells are safe to click on.</li>
            <li>You can mark a cell with a mine on it by right clicking, and unflag the cell by right clicking again.</li>
            <li>You can click hint which will show a square that does not have a mine in it.</li>
            <li>Solve will help partially solve the game from its current state.</li>
