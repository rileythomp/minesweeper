        <h1>Minesweeper</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The goal is to safely reveal every non-mine square without clicking on a mine as quick as possible.</li>
            <li>If you click on a square with a mine, you lose.</li>
            <li>If you click on a non-mine square, it will reveal the number of mines in the 8 squares that surround it.</li>
            <li>If there are no mines surroudning that square, it will reveal all the squares surrounding it recursively.</li>
            <li>Using the number of mines surrounding a cell, you can deduce which cells are safe to click on.</li>
            <li>You can flag a square you know has a mine on it by right clicking, and unflag the cell by right clicking again.</li>
            <li>You can click hint to show a square that does not have a mine on it.</li>
            <li>You can click solve to partially solve the board.</li>
